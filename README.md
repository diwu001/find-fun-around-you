# Project Overview

In this project, a single-page map-based application is developed using KnockoutJS Framework and Google Map API. It featurs the upcoming Meetup events in your neighborhood you may want to attend. Event data is retrieved by AJAX requests to Meetup API. Data parsing and rendering components are designed and implemented.

# How to run the project

- Open index.html by browser. 

- Enter the location you want to search, then click 'Search'. All meetup events around that location will showup. 

- Enter the event type, such as 'Tech', 'Food' or 'Sport'. Then click 'Filter', the specific type of events can be filtered. 

- Click one of the search result or click the marker on the map will open an infowindow provide detailed information about that event. 

- Filter condition can be reset. Search results can be hidden or show.
